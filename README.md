TODO:
Tune resolution or fidelity of edit position movements, they are coarser than they should be.
Fix the "aircraft front gear" adjustment, it hasn't been added yet.
Fix the edit "altitude" adjustment, I still have to debug it and figure out why it isn't working.
Clean up..
Docs to explain it use and configuration.
Wiki rewrite, see the Readme file for the wiki address of the current wiki article. This article was written for the nasal installed version.
